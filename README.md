# Scope-of-salaries-in-IT-jobs-from-2020-to-2022
Analyzing the trend(demand) and the salaries for IT roles in data science that were paid before, during, and post-COVID.


### Brief Description:
This project is for my self-practice, which is made by keeping the public in mind who want to know how covid 19 affected the trend of IT roles. This narrates the findings on the salaries for various IT roles, mostly related to the data science field during the three COVID stages in 2020, 2021, and 2022. I wanted to tell the audience about the average salary paid to the employee, which is based on job role, location of the company(country name), and year. A map is visualized with the geo-location point of the country, which describes the country name, average covid 19 cases in that year, and average salary. In addition to this map is a bar chart plotted, which visualizes the average wage of different job roles paid in a particular country. Both the map and bar chart are entirely interactive, and the project is implemented using Shiny.
